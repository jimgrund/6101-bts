#' Target Variables -->
# DepDelay (Includes Negatives)
# DepDelayMinutes (Same as DepDelay but negs are 0)
# DepDel15 --> Flag if DepDelay >15
# DepartureDelayGroups --> Bins DepDelay (-2:12)

#'Questions -->
# We could focus on DepDep15 --> and use Logistic Regression too see what variables are most important...or predict whether or not a flight will be delayed
# Does Distance affect delay?
# Is there a difference in Delays by Airport? Is it signif?
